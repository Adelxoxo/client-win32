2007-07-15 - nQuake v1.3

* Setup no longer attempts to copy pak1.pak if it already exists in the installation directory.
* Setup no longer steals focus when copying pak1.pak.
* Setup now checks the validity of pak1.pak.

* Improved initialization process.

2007-07-14 - nQuake v1.2

* nQuake is now the solid package it claims to be - the user has no choices as to what packages are installed.
* When uninstalling, user gets the choice of removing just the files nQuake installed, or removing the nQuake folder altogether.
* nQuake now backups old config file (ezquake/configs/config.cfg) if installed into an old Quake directory.
* Installer no longer temporarily creates a distfiles.log in the distfiles directory (useless).
* Setup is now clean of popup messages where they could be avoided.
* The installer has been generally cleaned up.

2007-07-09 - nQuake v1.1
