2007-07-09 - nQuake v1.1

* Installer now asks if it should keep the distribution files instead of asking to delete them.
* Installer now looks for pak1.pak on 21 likely locations. If pak1.pak is not found, the user gets to browse for it.
* Fixed the bug where nQuake wouldn't detect newer versions if the current version was x.0x.

2007-07-05 - nQuake v1.01

* Added link to gfx.qwdrama.com in Links.
* Fixed bug where installer doesn't remove distfiledates.ini from nquake-distfiles.
* Changed "Improved Visuals" to "Enhanced Graphics".
